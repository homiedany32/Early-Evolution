    <p>What is this exactly:</p>
    <p>This is a simulation of how early living beings survive and how they mutate for their offspring to survive in the future, this example has
        Blobs without eyes, relying on their sense of touch to find food
        <p></p>
        <p>How this works:</p>
        Each generation of blobs(blue coloured) will go out each day and get food.  All of these blobs do not have eyes, but they have mouths, so
        they will run around to find and eat food until they run out of energy, if a blob ate two food they will immediately run out of energy
        and when the next generation occurs, this blob will survive and produce a new blob.  If a blob only eats one food and runs out of energy
        it'll only survive to the next day without producing a new blob.  If a blob doesn't eat a food when it runs out of energy it'll die when
        the next generation occurs.  New generations occur when all of the blobs lose all of their energy, lost of energy is calculated by the X translation
        to the power of two, plus the Y translation to the power of two, plus the size(radius) multiplied by 3, all of these factors added together is how
        much energy loss each blob loses per frame.  Every new generation has a 50/50 chance to mutate either their speed and/or their size to 
        increase or decrease these values.  You can interact with certain values of the simulation, you can adjust the: Starting blob count, Starting food
        count, Energy of the Blobs, Increasing/Decreasing the food count each generation and how much to change it by.  You can also change the Width 
        and Height of the simulation, but you need to hit the reset button
